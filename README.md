# mi5-module-js-example
This example shows how to use [mi5-module-js](https://github.com/ProjectMi5/mi5-module-js).

## Setup

* You need to have installed the newest [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version.
* Download and unzip this repository to your local machine or having git installed, run
```git clone https://github.com/ProjectMi5/mi5-module-js-example.git```
* Navigate to this folder in your console and run `npm install`. (Alternatively, you can double-click on `01-installation.cmd`, if you are working with Windows.)
* Run the example with `node example` (Alternative: `02-runExample.cmd`)

## Have a look at your OPC UA Server

If you want to browse your server or play with it, you might want to use the [UaExpert OPC UA Client](https://www.unified-automation.com/downloads/opc-ua-clients.html). It is for free but you are required to register first. Have a look at the console output to see at which port the server is listening. If you do not change the settings, it will be `opc.tcp://127.0.0.1:4842`

## Learn something

* Make yourself familiar with the file `example.js`.
* For more information refer to the documentation provided by the [mi5-module-js](https://github.com/ProjectMi5/mi5-module-js).
